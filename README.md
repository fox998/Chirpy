## üê¶ Chirpy - A Basic Go HTTP Server

**Chirpy** is a simple, educational project implementing a foundational **HTTP server** in **Go (Golang)**.

This repository serves as a practical exercise and final project for the **Boot.dev** course: [**Learn HTTP Servers with Go**](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-http-servers-golang).

-----

### üöÄ Getting Started

To run the Chirpy server locally, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fox998/Chirpy.git
    cd Chirpy
    ```

2.  **Run the server:**

    ```bash
    go run .
    ```

The server should start on the specified port (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`), ready to handle basic HTTP requests.

### üìö Education Project Context

The code demonstrates core concepts of building an HTTP server, including:

  * Routing requests
  * Handling JSON data
  * Middleware for authentication and logging
  * Basic database (in-memory or file-based) interactions

Feel free to explore the code to see a practical implementation of the concepts taught in the referenced Boot.dev course.
